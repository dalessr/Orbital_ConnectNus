    <string name="user_info1">1. Around Me:\nThis is a page with all kinds of news and information that is relevant to students. It will show students the events or notice that currently comes out, so that they are able to know more about what is happening on campus.\n\n</string>
    <string name="user_info2">2. Lost and Found:\nIn this column, students who have found any unclaimed items can make a post here, and people who have lost their belongings can search for them from all the posts. We have created an item list, and several buttons so that students can create new posts or see all the posts here. They need to briefly describe the item they have found, their location and contact information. Also, they are able to save and submit their posts or delete their posts.\n\n</string>
    <string name="user_info3">3. Stuff Exchange:\nSimilar to the lost and found function, we are also going to build another platform here for students to post items that they do not want to own anymore. Students who are looking for goods can come to the platform and search for items that they want. Also, we are going to improve the categorising and searching system in order to make it more convenient for users to search for items.\n\n</string>
